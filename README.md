# Enigma Server

This is the primary repo for the Enigma project. The project is creating an open-source configurably-authoritative server for indie video games.

The goal of this project is to facade away implementation details of a multiplayer environment as much as possible, but handling networking, synchronization, server-side code and network authority.

All of these to make sure developers can focus on making their games great, and less about the technical details of implementing a server.
